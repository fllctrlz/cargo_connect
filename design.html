		<h2>Design Process 2</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height,
		balance, drive train, sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. 
		We also strive to design and build a base robot which is robust and which features a frame around 
		the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square up against walls and mission models. 
		We design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be easy to install and remove, 
		robust, and both passive and multi-purpose whenever possible. 
		From testing the prototype base robot and the attachments, we make revisions to our work in order 
		to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve maximum efficiency, 
		through completion time and size. By the end of the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.
		</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2> Our Base Robot</h2>
	<br>

	<p>
		Our robot is very robust and compact with a frame for strength and an easier way to drop on attachments. We use four light sensors,
	
		with shielding from ambient light. Our robot has two small trailing wheels at the back of the frame, which are steering neutral, and small sized wheels with a small diameter.
		These small wheels allow for more accurate movements as they decrease the error associated with the drive motor rotation sensors.
		However, we sacrifice some speed due to our wheels having a small diameter.	Our robot also has three guide wheels, on the sides of the robot to follow the wall.

		<h2>Example of Robotic Testing Conducted by Ctrl-Z </h2>
		
		
	
		<br>
		<h4>Making the Robot Drive Straight</h4>
		<p>We have found that the move functions provided by the EV3 suite are unreliable. Although they have
			a
			built in PID feature, they still do not move the robot in a straight line. To test this, we set a designated
			starting spot
			for the robot and then we ran it until it hit the wall on the other side of the table. We repeated this
			dozens of times
			and found that each time it would end up in a different spot on the other side of the table. Each time it
			would be up to
			an inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error-corrected movement function (which you can read
			about in the
			programming section of this website). We conducted the same experiment using our block and found that there
			was much less error
			and the robot would consistently end up in the same position on the table.

					<td class="tick-border">"Z" Cargo Plane Arm</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This attachment, which lowers the Cargo Plane door, consists of a long arm and a series of gears that engages 
						with the medium "D" motor in the rear of the robot.  For ease of installation,
						the attachment rests in the robot's bay and the Technic knob gear on the 
						attachment easily engages with the motor.  Using bevel gears to change the 
						angular direction of movement of the upward-pointing motor, allows the long 
						arm to swing 
						from side to side to hit the large airplane cargo door handle to release the 
						cargo onto the mat.  After the cargo has been deposited onto the mat, the 
						modified L-shaped liftarms at the end of arm are used to reposition the cargo 
						into the black scoring circle.

						The attachment is connected to the medium "D" motor at the rear of the robot that is 
						attached to knob gear attached to an axle which rotates a large spur gear. Then another
						axle is connected, using a pin connector and a pin with no friction ridges to the 
						furthest most outer rim of the large spur gear.
