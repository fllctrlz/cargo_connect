<h3> 
	Robert Suga of Atlantic Packaging:

<h4> Oct 27 and Nov 2, 2021</h4>
<ul> 

<li> The Z-Box is a very good concept.  He understands that it is an insert or
	 an inner box which would be used together with an outer shell carton.</li>

<li>Adding an inner box would not  be cost-prohibitive to shippers and their customers.
 One must consider that there is also a cost to using popcorn or sealed air bags.  
 Shippers would be open to using Z-box to replace currently used void-fillers.  The concept of an inner and an outer 
 box should not be a problem considering that shippers commonly ship boxes within boxes already.
</li>

<li> The Z-box would be a die-cut box with punch outs. 
</li>

<li>We would need to offer a small, medium and large size.
</li>

<li>The Flexo folder die (i.e. the tooling) to cut the Z-Box would cost $1,000 to create.
</li>

<li> In manufacturing, the Z-Box "would be run alongside the outer shell carton".
</li>

<li>
	For a typical mid-sized Amazon outer carton, the cost the customer would be 
	$0.50 to $0.75 per unit where the customer pays for the tooling.  This 
	assumes a trailer-load purchase of 10,000 units and assumes 32 ECT C-Flute.  There would 
	also be a $300- $400 1-color outer print plate cost.  If 23 
	ECT B-Flute were used, the cost of the outer carton would reduce 
	to $0.40 per unit.   He  suggested that the outer carton could be made of the B-Flute to be cost-efficient.
	</li>

<li>The inner box would contain no graphics and could therefore be produced at the 
	same cost, $0.50 to $0.75 per unit (using 32 ECT C-Flute for more 
	structure for the flaps).  For reference, 32 ECT represents 50% of 
	total containerboard output, so it is very common.  Heavier 44 ECT 
	would be used for products that go into the freezer and 23 ECT is for more lightweight products.
</li>

</ul>

Allen Kirkpatrick of the Canadian Corrugated and Containerboard Association:
</h3>

<h4>Oct 27, 2021
</h4>

<ul>

<li>	
He suggested that next steps could be using 32 ECT C-Flute (Edge Crush Test  3/16" thick)
containerboard for the next prototype.  We could try to ask for some outer
shipper boxes and some slightly smaller inner boxes.  He initially 
suggested using B-Flute (1/8" thick) containerboard for the inner box 
but after some discussion about the need for ridgidity of the arms/flaps,
it was decided that C-Flute should be used for both the 
inner box and the outer box.  B-Flute is often used to make beer boxes.
</li>

<li>
He talked about the possibility of using folding carton for the inner 
box, but decided that this would provide much less structure than the
team needs.  Folding carton is often used because it is a better graphic
substrate, which is not relevant for the Z-Box since the inner box will not be seen anyway.
</li>

<li>
When costing our product, he recommended using a $0.10 - $0.11 per square foot rule-of-thumb for containerboard.
</li>
